# Recursion on Arrays - C Project

Welcome to this project dedicated to learning and implementing **recursion** in **C language**, applied to **arrays**. This project offers several classic recursive functions, ideal for understanding recursive logic through concrete examples.

## Objective

Explore how to use recursion to:
- Traverse an array
- Reverse an array
- Calculate statistics (sum, max, min, etc.)
- Search for an element
- Solve classic problems (sorting, searching, etc.)

## Why recursion?

> "Recursion is when a function calls itself to solve a subproblem of the original problem."

It is powerful for certain types of problems, such as tree processing, sorting/search algorithms, or recursive manipulation of data structures.

## Implemented functions

| Function                                | Description |
|----------------------------------------|-------------|
| `void print_array(int *arr, int size)` | Recursively prints the elements of the array |
| `void reverse_array(int *arr, int start, int end)` | Reverses the array in place |
| `int sum_array(int *arr, int size)`    | Recursively calculates the sum of elements |
| `int max_array(int *arr, int size)`    | Returns the maximum element in the array |
| `int contains(int *arr, int size, int val)` | Checks if an element exists |
| `void recursive_bubble_sort(int *arr, int n)` | Recursively sorts the array with bubble sort |
